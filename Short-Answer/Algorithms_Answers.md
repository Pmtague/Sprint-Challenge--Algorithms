#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n). Each increase in n increases the runtime by n. If n = 1, the while loop runs 1 time. If n = 2, the while loop runs 2 times, etc.


b) O(logn). As n increases, the runtime does not increase every time. Runtime grows at a slower rate than n.


c) O(n). Runtime increases at the same rate as n.
